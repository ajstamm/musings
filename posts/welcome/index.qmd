I work at the state department of health. While I was trained as a health educator and epidemiologist, I do neither of those right now. I may write later about some of the work I am doing.

I have wanted for years to start a blog, where I could write about whatever has most recently caught my attention. (My family has wanted me to start one ever since receiving my letters home from the Pace Corps twenty years ago.) I moved to Minnesota a little over a year ago to start a new job as an informatician and joined a religious community that is not the one in which I was raised. I have been making new friends and learning new things about myself and how I identify. 

My goal with this blog is to write journal-type reflective pieces, maybe short stories about my daily experiences. I do not know yet how frequently I will update or what themes will emerge as I write. In this blog, I plan to focus on activities outside of work, such as my art, Toastmasters, and church activities. I may also write about local events and activities with family and friends. 


The image below is of an HIV virus I made 10 years ago. Read more about it on [deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/anabiyeni/art/Beaded-HIV-virus-513907744). Back then, I believed after graduation I would find another job in HIV work. (Spoiler: I did not.)
