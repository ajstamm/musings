I work at the state department of health. While I was trained as a health educator and epidemiologist, I do neither of those right now. I may write later about some of the work I am doing.

In this blog, I plan to focus on activities outside of work, such as my art, Toastmasters, and church activities. I may also write about local events and activities with family and friends. 

The image below is of an HIV virus I made 10 years ago. Read more about it on [deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/anabiyeni/art/Beaded-HIV-virus-513907744). Back then, I believed after graduation I would find another job in HIV work. (Spoiler: I did not.)
