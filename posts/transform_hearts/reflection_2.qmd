My second contemplative prayer group reflection was due yesterday. The assignment is very open-ended: a 700 word essay about our experience or an art piece with a short description. The only theme I could think about was how the program feels very nebulous and ad hoc to me. We learn a bunch of tools, and then what? Meanwhile the ongoing (and tired) cliche at work is that we are building a plane while flying it, especially as we struggle to meet the status quo with fewer resources. 

I set that aside for a bit and spent last Saturday patronizing bookstores all over Minneapolis. I had a few coupons left over from Independent Bookstore Day back in April and wanted to use them before they expired. At one bookstore, I picked up a copy of Lynda Barry's *Making Comics*. That evening, I tried a few of the exercises in it. For the exercise to draw oneself as a fruit or vegetable, I drew an adorable tamarind person.

The next day, after church, I sat down with my sketchbook and forced myself to draw something. The result was a partially built plane with tamarind people crawling all over it. That was the original sketch for what became my reflective piece. I wrote for my assignment, 

> I've been struggling with the Transforming Hearts program because there does not seem to be a clearly defined goal. 
> As a former teacher, I'm used to "By the end of this course, participants will ..." 
> Instead, we have been learning random things, represented by the panels for the plane's wing in the image. 
> Much like the people holding the panels, we are struggling to figure out how they fit together. 
> Meanwhile, the course continues coasting along as everyone, I think including the organizers, tries to figure out what we are doing.

This image is a simplified version of my sketch, which included the whole plane, including people meditating and a lot more panels lying around. The panels being used (debated over?) include one with a spiral (the simplest form of labyrinth), one with a lit candle, and one with a singing bowl with its cushion and mallet. Our group has used all of these in various prayer practices.

I had stated in my blog entry for my first reflection that I was hoping to create a sculpture this time. That didn't happen, but now I want to make a crochet or plush tamarind person and I found a mini singing bowl to use as a prop, so maybe next time? The next reflection will be due in about four months.

The image below is my reflective piece, a cartoon of tamarind people building a plane while flying it. This one has not been posted on [deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/anabiyeni/) yet.
