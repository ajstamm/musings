This past week I was at my church after wrk nearly every day helping with the church rummage sale. I got to learn all about everything that goes into the sale from dragging shelves and hangers and garment racks from the storage room to putting tablecloths on the "treasures" tables for itms like jewelry and fine china, to organizing books in the library and clothes in the choir room. 

I voted to put all trousers together and all shirts together irrespective of targeted gender since I couldn't differentiate "male" clothes from "female" clothes if my life depended on it. I guess one could assume (erroneously) that dresses are necessarily female, though robes and tunics are not, and they all get hung on the same garment rack anyway. I bought as many scarves as I donated.

I also bought a few books, including the Nordic eddas. I later learned they were donated by the husband of my friend who bought nearly all the graphic novels I had donated. He intends to put the graphic novels in his classroom for his students to read.

I'm just happy the items I no longer use have found new homes. Nearly everything that did not sell was packed up to be donated to the [Department of Indian Work](https://interfaithaction.org/what-we-do/diw/). About 25% of the proceeds of the sale are going to [Sprockets](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/sprockets), an organization that provides services and programming for school kids. 

This weekend I finally looked into volunteer opportunities through Sprockets, which led to sending a few inquiries to some local educational and environmental programs.


The image below is of a bookmark showing the logo of the School for Early Development and Achievement, a charter school that used to be run by the [Milwaukee Center for Independence](https://cfihope.org/) in Milwaukee, WI. I worked there while studying for my Masters degree.
