    "text": "The week of my dad’s birthday is always hard for me. I miss his support and advice. I miss the way he would listen to whatever I was struggling with, then without judgment, he’d ask, “What do you think?” When I was maybe ten he asked me, “Did God create humans or did humans create God?” I have been thinking about that question as I work through the Ignatian exercises.\nMy favorite activity this week was the reading from Matthew 4:18-22. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I imagined myself helping Zebedee mend his nets in the shore while his sons alternately mended nets and goofed off, as restless, dissatisfied boys are wont to do. The salty fishy smell was so strong I was struggling to breathe deeply and I kept hoping a breeze would pick up and offer reprieve from both the smell and the heat. Zebedee and I both noticed the itinerant preacher wandering past. A couple other fishermen, acquaintances of Zebedee’s sons, were wandering with him. I wondered who they had left manning their boat. Then the preacher called out to us. I stayed with Zebedee, not much interested in chasing after a bunch of young men; I’d done that enough as a teacher (please forgive the anachronism). Zebedee’s sons had no such reservations and with barely a “Farewell” to us, they were off.\nThe activity asked, “How do you feel about being included with those called to follow Jesus?” In the context of this reading, not good. I am not a young man and I don’t see myself in a group of young men. It isn’t lack of interest; I did the “how far will you go” thing with Peace Corps, and loved it. I’ve stood on the shores of Lake Victoria with people mending nets and I’ve hiked miles when no vehicle or bicycle taxi could be found. As much as I loved those days, I rarely miss them. I like my life now. In my imagination, I was content mending nets with Zebedee. Had I still been twenty-something and dreaming of Peace Corps, I might have run off with his sons instead, to be the token female in the group.\nThe image below is of a school of tiny fishes I made while living in Malawi. Read more about it on deviantArt. Many of these fish were later regifted to random friends. Challenge: can you find the two Disney fish below?\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "text": "This week also saw a reading from John 6:16-21. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I get motion sick very easily. I found myself reliving crossing Lake Malawi in a dhow during the rainy season. Some distance from shore, visibility dropped to zero, so the crew stopped the boat in the middle of the lake and waited for the storm to calm. I stayed by the back, drenched through, retching, and struggling just to breathe. The crew and most of my friends huddled under the tarp in the middle of the boat, but crew members were smoking there and I wanted to avoid smoke-induced nausea on top of sesickness.\nI imagined the disciples’ crossing was much like my own journey had been. Placing myself in the scene, I was just as seasick as I’d been on Lake Malawi. As a result, if I noticed Jesus at all, I shrugged him off as a hallucination. Likely I did not notice him and was only vaguely aware of the disciples shouting. I probably assumed they were shouting at each other about the storm. They knew how sick I was; they’d likely leave me be until we reached shore.\nThe activity asked, “How do you feel when you realize you are on the shore?” I was grateful the seasickness passed quickly and I could finally focus on something other than my stomach and esophagus. Of course, by that time Jesus was long gone. Hearing the crew retell it - “How did you miss it?” they asked me - I thought they must have hallucinated. Then I went in search of beer (being generally safer to drink than water) to wash the bile out of my mouth.\nThe image below is of a Viking longboat made of Delica beads. Read more about it on deviantArt. I made it about 15 years after I spent a semester in Denmark studying Nordic culture and history.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "text": "I was raised in and east-coast Roman Catholic university community. Since leaving that small progressive enclave, I’ve struggled to find a Catholic church where I feel welcome to be myself, or in some cases welcome at all. Here in the twin cities, I stopped trying. Now I attend an Episcopal church near my house. I have found them to be welcoming and supportive as I discern who I am and what I believe. Best of all, there is no expectation that I convert to Episcopalianism.\nThere is a Jesuit church near my house that organizes Lenten Ignatian retreats. Since I was raised to believe strongly in social justice and in discernment, which are both important in Ignatian theology, I signed up to participate. The group has only met once so far and I did not know anyone in advance, so I am curious what I will learn.\nLast year I had participated in a Lenten group led by the priest. By the end of Lent, the group was just the priest and me, which felt awkward mostly because the priest actively disagreed with half of what I said and failed to understand most of the rest. The point of the retreats is to learn together and build on each other’s observations, not shut people down by invalidating them.\nThe image below is of an angel I made over 15 years ago.

    "text": "My favorite activity this week was the reading from John 2:1-12. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I imagined myself gossiping with the agogos (grandmothers) and some other women, including Mary and the mother of the groom. We watch the other guests, the newly married couple, Mary’s son with his friends. I wonder how they were invited, but feel it would be rude to ask. Maybe they are friends of the groom.\nAt some point, a nervous steward comes over to tell the mother of the groom that the wine is nearly finished. Personally, I feel there has been enough drinking today, but many of the guests, that rowdy group with Jesus for example, will not respond well if the wine runs out. Mary, the enabler, calls her son over to enlist his help. A few of us speculate how far he will travel and how much he will pay to find sufficient wine to last this crowd through the night. I had expected he would be all for dragging off a few friends to find more wine and be the heroes of the moment, so I am surprised by his rude response. Then I recall how rowdy some of his friends and wonder if he feels as I do, that there has been quite enough drinking tonight. Nonetheless, he acquiesces and leaves to do her bidding.\nA short time later, the steward reappears with wine I am informed is high quality and we again start speculating about the cost. He won’t say where the wine had come from, but some of the other workers claim Jesus had created it, somehow magicked water into wine like witchcraft. I decide it’s probably best to stay quiet. While I don’t condemn witchcraft out of hand, I am wary of it until I know the caster’s intentions. Most of the rest of the guests are just happy there’s more wine and think nothing of it until the story starts to spread the next day and they are quick to point out, “We were there!” I stay quiet and watch.\nThe activity asked, “How do you respond to Jesus turning water into wine?” Wary. That stunt served no purpose except maybe to irk his mother, who was concerned only for her friend’s reputation. Why was he so annoyed with her anyway? Because he knew her request was selfish? I don’t understand how this is a noteworthy miracle.\nThe image below is of a wine charm I made years ago. Read more about it on deviantArt. Around that time, my mother had complained we didn’t have enough wine charms for all of the guests at our winter solstice parties, where we’d serve glog made from dad’s homemade wine, so I made several wine charms from old necklace pendants and bracelet charms. This is one of maybe a dozen that I made out of beads, and one of the few that I have kept. I recall the wine glass had been part of a gift box of Harlequin romances. I kept the glass because I liked the color; I never got around to reading the books.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "text": "We are in week two of the Ignatian lenten retreat. Today I’m going to focus on one of my reflections in week one, though. My favorite activities in the retreat are when we imagine ourselves in the scene. We can be anyone, Jesus, another named (or unnamed) character, or a random bystander. I most enjoy being a random bystander and thinking about, as myself (a self-insert?) I am there and what my reaction would be were I to experience whatever is happening.\nMy favorite activity in week one was on day four, when we were assigned to read Matthew 3:13-17 and instructed to imagine ourselves watching John the Baptist and Jesus. In my vision, I went to the riverbank to learn what John had to say. People had been talking about him and his teachings in my village and I was curious. I have no intention of being baptized, though; I’m terrified of water and whatever fauna may lurk beneath the surface.\nWhile we are listening to John, his cousin shows up. We’ve seen him around; they seem to get on well and enjoy teasing each other. I am not there to listen to their banter, though. I tire quickly of their “Baptize me”, “No, you baptize me” and am thinking about leaving when John finally decides to humor his cousin. I’ll give him points for showmanship, though. He timed it for just as the sun is breaking through the clouds. If only I could figure out how he managed that creepy disembodied voice shouting about a beloved son.\nI think my dissatisfaction with the Catholic church right now heavily colored my reading. I do enjoy the image of Jesus and John teasing each other like siblings, though. It makes them more three-dimensional for me, more relatable.\nThe image below is of a green striped zebra I made while living in Malawi. Read more about it on deviantArt. I’m guessing it was the dry season and I was tired of the dusty brown everywhere.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "text": "This week has been difficult at work. Decisions from higher-ups have left me feeling bewildered, uncertain, and unvalued. My interpretation of the reading I chose for today reflected that.\nMy second reading this week was from John 6:1-14. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I imagined myself curious as I wandered after the crowd that was following Jesus. Some grasped his robes, begging for healing. Others pushed their children into his arms, seeking blessings. Some watched him warily. Many, like me, were just curious. His fame preceded him and we wanted to know if he was as great as the tales would have us believe. By the time we reached the field on the mountain - perhaps a shelf or plateau or saddle - most of the women and children had dropped away, leaving only men and a few older boys and me.\nOne of the boys carried a basket of bread and salted fish, probably diverted on his way home from the market. When Jesus declared the people (read: men) must be fed, the disciples commandeered his basket. Then they passed out the food to the men, who must have been ashamed seeing the boy lose his entire basket, because they coughed up whatever they were carrying stone soup style so in the end, everyone had food. I hoped someone would remember to return the boy’s basket with food for his family, but with his usefulness ended, the disciples apparently forgot entirely that he existed. I have felt a lot like that boy this week.\nThe activity asked, “In what way are you hungry?” I’m seeking a spiritual community that embodies the phrase “All are welcome” without shame or fear or discrimination or erasure, a community that meets people where they are and accepts them for who they are, even when the members don’t understand them. My favorite line in the Nicene Creed is “We believe in one holy catholic apostolic church”. That is the community I want, where what and how you believe don’t matter nearly as much as being part of the community and supporting and being supported by the community.\nThe image below is of a beaded flying dragon-type serpent called an amphiptere. Read more about it on deviantArt. I wanted to pick an art piece more relevant to the story, but I’ve never made beaded bread and apparently I never posted my beaded basket online. Mountain made me think dragon, so here we are. Also, it’s spring (for a few days, until we get more snow) here in Minnesota, so pastel feels appropriate.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My reading for today was from Mark 14:43-52. This was an “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity from last year’s retreat. I chose it today because I’ve been thinking about it all week. Two weeks ago, a few friends were laid off from work overnight - called in the evening and told not to show up for work the next day, and by the way, their accounts were already deactivated with no chance to hand over any of their outstanding work. Last week, more friends received emails about midday informing them that they had been laid off and they had half an hour for handover before their accounts would be deactivated. Still more friends will not know their fate until next week.\nI work for the state department of health. These layoffs immediately followed the federal government’s decision to withhold “COVID” funds, citing nonsense about the COVID pandemic being over. First, the COVID pandemic is not over. Second, those funds were not just being used for COVID. They were funding desperately needed data infrastructure and disease surveillance improvements. Surveillance that included monitoring outbreaks of Measles, Bird Flu, and other infectious diseases.\nIn Minnesota, from what I understand, the two divisions most impacted by the loss of those funds were the infectious disease division and the data strategy and interoperability office, where I work. The loss of so many staff in these divisions has already started to adversely impact the work of local public health, tribal health, and the residents of Minnesota. We can only guess what the long-term impact will be as we struggle to stabilize existing infrastructure and maintain relationships.\nI chose this reading, of Judas betraying Jesus, because I feel much like I imagine Jesus feels here, betrayed by someone he trusted and trying to remain calm and keep his followers calm. We have been betrayed by the federal government. We feel angry, but violence is not the answer. Like Jesus, we are watching decades of public health work crumble, hastened along by people wo do not value public health, who do not care about the marginalized, the very people Jesus and the prophets before him preached to protect. The federal government is trying to erase data on women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and those experiencing environmental injustice, in short anyone who is not a rich white cisgender male. Jesus was not rich or white and 2000 years ago, the concept of cisgender did not exist.\nIn some apocryphal stories, Judas repented. I pray that the leaders of this country, like Judas, will one day realize and understand the harm they have caused. In the meantime, I pray that those of us left in public health can find ways to continue our work to protect and preserve the health of the people in our communities, especially those who are most marginalized.\nThe image below is of the cat I had in Uganda, Enshonga the terror, attacking the horse stable I had worked so hard to make. My goal that night was to take a photograph of my art to send home to my parents, but Enshonga had other ideas. Her wanton disregard for the hard work I put into my art fits the mood at work right now. Read more about this piece on deviantArt.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are in week six of the Ignatian Lenten retreat, but I didn’t participate at all last week with everything at work, so now I’m playing catch-up. Work has been a mixture of putting projects on hold until we know how many people on our team will be laid off and preparing for our presentation yesterday at ShinyConf.\nThe presentation went well and now Eric wants to create an R package that simplifies making online dashboards accessible. This afternoon, we discussed what such a package would look like. I think it will be a mix of accessibility checks and functions to simplify adding accessible content. Functions would cover things like alt text, aria labels, and maybe a color suggester like my coworker’s Color Optimizer. I suggested we should have a function generate a report called the Accessibility Audit.\nMy prayer activity today is a reading from Luke 20:9-19. I don’t understand this parable, so I struggled a bit. I am watching from a distance. Perhaps I am in the next vineyard, or a relative of a tenant in this one. I don’t understand what the tenants are thinking by refusing to pay. Do they want to be thrown out? Then to attack the man’s slaves, who have less freedom than they? Are they bullies? I don’t have a clue what they expect to accomplish. What’s their cause? Why are they willing to risk being evicted? I don’t understand the landlord, either. Should he not have evicted them after the third strike? I feel sorry for his son, a naive young man who has never struggled a day in his life. I am not surprised they don’t heed him. I am surprised they kill him. To what end? Do they think they will be able to steal the land? The landlord’s status is higher than theirs and they’ve killed his son now; he has the might of the local law enforcement behind him. So he kills and replaces them. That’s predictable, at least.\nAccording to my annotated bible, the vineyard is Israel and the landlord’s son is Jesus, but I don’t get it. Jesus wasn’t a naive heir; he was a threat to the Romans. And Israel as the vineyard I also don’t follow, unless Jesus was hoping the Romans would be wiped out, which is possible. I chose this reading today because I’ve been thinking about work and bullies and misuse of power.\nAt work we still have no idea who or how many people will be laid off in two weeks, which positions will be entirely eliminated, which teams might be entirely disbanded or absorbed into other teams, how layoffs were selected. People I’ve spoken to understand there’s no money and people need to be laid off, but the entire process has been chaotic and opaque, with no meaningful attempt to calm or reassure us. The empty platitudes we have received are worse than useless - they breed resentment.\nMuch as I don’t understand the tenants in this parable who ultimately and shortsightedly destroyed themselves, I don’t understand the entirely unnecessary and drawn-out trauma our leadership is inflicting on the Department of Health. It’s leading to distrust in leadership, burnout, fear, and fatigue among very talented, very hard-working staff, many of whom are veterans of COVID (myself included), who are now asking if maybe they should be looking for jobs elsewhere even if they did not get at-risk letters. The public health system here, and throughout the US, is suffering from insufficient capacity and cannot afford to lose any more good workers, so why is my department’s leadership trying to drive people away on top of the layoffs? I feel like one of the landlord’s slaves, unheard and unvalued.\nThe image below is of a Malawian oxcart pulled by two European oxen. I made the oxcart and a couple zebus to pull it while serving in the Peace Corps. Seven years later, I finally photographed it, but I’d managed to lose the zebus in the interim. Read more about this set on deviantArt. I chose this image because the slaves had no agency and no idea what they were walking into, much like the cattle here.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "text": "My reading for today was from Matthew 26:30-46. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I chose it today because it’s the first reading of Week 6. I’ve followed Jesus and his best friends to Gethsemane. I’m not sure why I’m here. I feel a bit like I’m encroaching on private friends’ time and maybe I should leave. I suppose my curiosity is overcoming my sense of propriety.\nJesus asks his friends to keep watch before going to pray. They fall asleep, which means they don’t notice me and chase me away. Jesus sounds upset, like every revolutionary ever. He has a mission that frustrates and angers and exhausts him, but he feels too strongly about it, identifies too strongly with it, to quit, despite the inherent dangers of being a revolutionary. So he’s having an especially bad day, which makes sense if someone tipped him off that he’ll be arrested today. Apparently it wasn’t his best friends; I can’t imagine they’d fall asleep if they expect he will be arrested today.\nAnd three’s the charm. After Jesus’ third prayer, he concludes, I suppose, that it’s best to stop hiding in the garden and get on with whatever is going to happen next. I stay hidden while they leave the garden. His friends look groggy, confused, maybe frustrated by his endless riddles. Better them than me; I’m bad at riddles and worse at subtlety.\nI feel sorry for Jesus, and for every other revolutionary who prays for a better world for everyone, especially the most marginalized, when they are doubting themselves. I feel far sorrier for those doing the marginalizing, that they are so out of touch with the world, maybe due to unhealed trauma, past pain or loss, or some other thing that hinders their self-awareness and awareness of the pain they cause others.\nI struggle with being aware of others and of my effect on them. However, if someone points out how I hurt them or someone else, I contemplate their words. Then I make an effort to mitigate the harm. Often this means minding my words in the future, maybe an apology in the moment, something easy to do and easy to remember. I wish my country’s leaders would do at least that much.\nThe image below is of two horses from the Danish card game, Bella Sara. Paris is the armored horse on the left. Wildflower, the pony on the right, has flowers in her mane and tail. This pair feels appropriate for a Gethsemane scene.

    "text": "Human Resources (HR) at work has decided to rescind the at-risk letters, properly evaluate who they can afford to lose across the department of health, and resend layoff letters on Easter Monday. For better or worse, at least they are following the union contract now. The language in the union contract is outdated and does ot apply to the reality at work. It stipulated that people whose jobs are being terminated can steal jobs from people with the same job classification, but lower seniority. The problem is “Research scientist” can mean bench scientist, informatician, data manager, epidemiologist, data analyst, and computer programmer. Most people are not more than two or three of those things, but in theory, as the contract is written, an epidemiologist who has never worked in a lab could steal the job of a bench scientist. HR decide entirely on their own based only on minimum qualifications, with no input from relevant supervisors.\nWe all anticipate any job stealing will go badly and lead to even more chaos than that introduced first by the botched at-risk letters, then in the next few weeks by the mass layoffs (not to mention the 120 people who have already been laid off and whose work halted overnight). I’m feeling especially jaded as I try to continue the Lenten readings.\nMy reading today was from Matthew 27:27-31. This was another “Imagine yourself in the scene” activity. I am watching, perhaps as a Roman soldier, or a slave, someone without power or agency of my own. Other soldiers drag Jesus into the room, strip him, and dress him in a military tunic. I think as a revolutionary and a threat to Roman rule, they see him as a soldier, anyway. The crown and reed feel over the top and tell me far more about them and their fears and insecurities than they do about Jesus, who refuses to respond to their bullying. Then, bullying unsuccessful and victim unprovoked, they claim back the tunic and return his clothes.\nThe discussion questions fall flat for me.\nQuestion 1: Could I endure pain without complaint? Given the way I spoke out after I was sexually assaulted, I’m guessing not, and that’s fine with me. Silent suffering does no one any good.\nQuestion 2: Could I ignore ignorant criticism? It depends. I often wear a headscarf and have been coded as Muslim both by people who greet me with an excited “Salaam aleichum” and by people who actively shun me or say things like “Go back to your own country.” I see no point in telling the latter I was born in Wisconsin, so I ignore them. I also ignore the people who see my Pride accessories and tell me I’m going to hell. Much like the soldiers, their behavior toward me tells me they are insecure, perhaps afraid, and I pity them.\nQuestion 3: What do I want Jesus to tell me as he suffers? Nothing. I want Jesus to focus on whatever he needs to focus on and the random soldier/slave/bystander I happen to represent is irrelevant. I wonder at the arrogance that must be necessary for someone to expect to be the primary focus of anyone in pain. Where is their compassion?\nAt work, we are all suffering through the uncertainty and anxiety together. We are all trying to support each other and give each other grace even as we suffer ourselves. Then someone from HR will say, in effect, “Look at me! I’m sorry for the anxiety you feel, but not really, because it’s all about me! Don’t you feel sorry for me?” And we are all just staring at the latest email full of platitudes, or listening to the latest HR meeting (no chat, no Q&A, no way for us to interact) full of more platitudes and think, “Feel sorry for you? When you won’t give us any straight answers and deliberately keep us uninformed? Are you mad?” I do not want to be like HR, ever. If someone is suffering, my focus should be on them, not me. Even if I am suffering, if they are, too, I would never want to expect their support, and if they offer it anyway, I should feel honored, not entitled.\nThe image below is of two beaded camels wearing bridles and saddles. Read more about it on deviantArt. I have very few beaded soldiers (Starfleet officers, a Romulan commander, and a knight from the show Merlin) and none of them are from Jesus’ time, so instead you get a a couple fancy camels that might have been part of Herod’s procession.\nThis post is part of my Lent 2025 Imaginative Readings series."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This past week I was at my church after work nearly every day helping with their rummage sale. I got to learn all about everything that goes into the sale from dragging shelves and hangers and garment racks from the storage room to putting tablecloths on the “treasures” tables for items like jewelry and fine china, to organizing books in the library and clothes in the choir room.\nI voted to put all trousers together and all shirts together irrespective of targeted gender since I couldn’t differentiate “male” clothes from “female” clothes if my life depended on it. I guess one could assume (erroneously) that dresses are necessarily female, though robes and tunics are not, and they all get hung on the same garment rack anyway. I bought as many scarves as I donated.\nI also bought a few books, including the Nordic Eddas. I later learned they were donated by the husband of my friend who bought nearly all the graphic novels I had donated. He intends to put the graphic novels in his classroom for his students to read.\nI’m just happy the items I no longer use have found new homes. Nearly everything that did not sell was packed up to be donated to the Department of Indian Work. About 25% of the proceeds of the sale are going to Sprockets, an organization that provides services and programming for school kids.\nThis weekend I finally looked into volunteer opportunities through Sprockets, which led to sending a few inquiries to some local educational and environmental programs.\nThe image below is of a bookmark showing the logo of the School for Early Development and Achievement, a charter school that used to be run by the Milwaukee Center for Independence in Milwaukee, WI. I worked there while studying for my Masters degree. Read more about this bookmark and see other bookmarks I have made on deviantArt."

    "text": "Thursday was a busy day for me. My first doctor’s appointment with a new doctor, followed by meeting with my contemplative prayer group. I liked my new doctor, partly because they are the first healthcare person to take me seriously when I said I think I have autism. To start, my doctor asked me to write a narrative about why I think I have autism, referencing the DSM-5. It’s seven pages long; I sent it last night. Future blog posts may be about my thoughts on masking and various autism self-assessments.\nAfter my doctor’s appointment and my first ever tornado warning (that I recall), during a break in the storm, I headed to church for our monthly contemplative prayer group meeting. Our group is in training through Episcopal House of Prayer to be able to lead prayer groups ourselves in the future.\nThis month is the first time a member of our cohort of four ran the prayer session without a facilitator. I appreciated that Holly offered to lead first and had the foresight to request a script to follow. (I would have muddled through on my own and handled it far worse than she did.) I remembered to bring my singing bowl, though.\nThe leader begins and ends each session by chiming the singing bowl. Then the leader briefly introduces the session with a prayer or reading and notes participant tone and expectations. Then we take a 5-10 minutes of silence. After the first silence, one person speaks for 3-5 minutes on whatever comes to mind, generally related to God and spirituality and something in our lives in the last month. On my turn, I spoke about my doctor’s appointment.\nAfter the person finishes speaking, we take two minutes of silence to contemplate their story. Then we spend, in total, 5-10 minutes providing feedback. The point of these feedback portions is to focus on and validate the person whose story we just heard. There are several ways to do this.\n\nDrawing. I like having index cards to draw a simple image for each person, so they have something tangible to take home after. The images I see are things like moonlight on water or plants sprouting. Sadly I forgot my index cards on Thursday. I tucked them in the case for my singing bowl when I got home, so I don’t forget next time.\nProviding word or short phrase, often without explanation. This appeals to my desire to find and understand patterns. I like the challenge of distilling the essence of someone’s story (or my understanding of it) to one word, like resilience or resonance or adversity. Last month, the one word another member heard in my story was survival. I like hearing what words stand out to others about my stories.\nAsking a question. The question should be thought-provoking, but not leading or judgmental or demanding. There is no expectation that the person answers. I struggle with this one.\nMaking an observation. Generally this is to clarify a contradiction you heard in their story or with something they had said earlier. Again, there should be no judgment or expectation of response. The focus should stay on the storyteller, not shift to the person observing. I’m still struggling to learn this method, too.\n\nI think it helps that we are all learning together, so we are tolerant and understanding of each other’s mistakes. I am trying to learn from the others’ mistakes as well as my own and I suspect the others are doing the same.\nAfter the feedback portion, we take about five minutes of silence before the next person speaks. After everyone has spoken and received feedback, we take 5-10 minutes of silence. Then the leader closes with a few words and chimes the singing bowl again.\nAfter the session is over, we always take a few minutes to chat about our experience as we clean up. A few themes have come up several times. Among them, from what I’ve understood:\n\nWe all joined the group because we are open to learning more about ourselves and others.\nSome of us like silence and could use more of it. Others appreciate the chance to learn to live in silence in a non-threatening environment.\nWe are all seeking deeper friendships and connections and appreciate that the prayer practice gives us an opportunity to feel heard and validated, and to learn how to help others feel heard and validated.\n\nThe next couple months will be led by House of Prayer and will give us an opportunity to meet with the other churches in our cohort. I look forward to hearing about the other churches’ experiences. Then in August, I think, we will lead ourselves again.\nI couldn’t find a good beadwork piece for this post, so enjoy one of my stuffed animals instead. The image below is of Hermette, an original nurse My Little Pony. Read more about her and see my other stuffed animals on deviantArt. Sadly, she did not weather the move to Minnesota well and her mane and tail are terribly straggly and frizzy now."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week my first reflection was due for the contemplative prayer group. The assignment: a 700 word essay, a five-minute video, or an art piece with a 100-word description. My solution: a poem, A moment in prayer (on AO3).\nI knew early on that I wanted to write something focused on the experience of contemplative prayer, a more sensory or emotional version of my last blog post and I thought poetry would work well for that. The issue: I had a page full of random disjointed phrases and rhyme pairs that were stubbornly refusing to work together. So I set it aside for a couple days.\nDuring the Memorial Day weekend sales I ordered a new computer (the one I’m typing on now), so I spent some time going through programs on my old computer, removing software I no longer use and saving a list to Obsidian of the software I wanted to install on this computer, starting with Firefox and of course Obsidian.\nI found two pieces of software I had used for my dissertation, Scapple and Scrivener, both by Literature & Latte. Scrivener is great for mapping out elements of an essay or story, where each element may have a lot of details. I find it easier to organize for that kind of thing than Obsidian. Scapple is designed for mind-mapping, which it does very well. It can also be used to map process flows and design layouts if necessary.\nOn a whim, I typed my random lines of poetry into Scapple. In my notebook, I’d written a couple possible words to provide starting letters for acrostics, so I laid out the letters in a column on the left. Next, I considered words to start lines and placed those lines beside the relevant letters. I still struggled with exact wording, keeping focus and verb tense consistent, and the rhyme scheme I wanted, but being able to move lines around helped bring everything together fairly easily. It was much easier than cutting up pieces of paper and cross out hand-written words, then revert to the crossed out words (if they were still legible at that point) when I changed my mind.\nWhen I was satisfied with the results, copying the relevant lines en masse to paste them to Obsidian (where I organize all my poetry) and then to Archive of our own (AO3) was straightforward. Takeaway: if you’re having trouble organizing ideas for a poem, try an unexpected solution like mind-mapping, and if you want to try Scapple, it’s free for 30 days. Other reasons I like Scapple are that it’s a small file and a lifetime license is inexpensive (I am not a fan of subscription models), so I didn’t need to repurchase it for my new computer.\nThe next reflective piece is due in September. I’m curious what form it will take. If you’ve visited my deviantArt account you probably know my primary medium is beadwork and lately I’ve been sculpting a lot with Speks. I’d like my next piece to be visual, using one of those media, or if I’m really ambitious, crochet, which I have been learning.\nThe image below is a beaded rainbow-colored spider. Read more about it and see my other beadwork on deviantArt. I chose this spider partly because mind-mapping makes me think webs and partly because Pride Month starts tomorrow."

    "text": "Last month, I finally completed the Section 508 Trusted Tester certification. The course was very long, with generally helpful examples for each test item. It went into a lot more detail about some of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAGs) than any other WCAG website I’ve visited, which I found very helpful. The practice tests were full of example pages that usually did a decent job of illustrating the concepts. In general, I’m impressed by the work the developers put into it. What I did not like so much is that some of the content apparently does not work consistently across platforms and for the text size tests, it expects your computer display is at least 1920 x 1200. As a result, in some cases, my experiences (and those of others who posted in the course forum) did not match the expected answer.\nAs I worked my way through the course, I ran the various checks on this blog. For the most part, this blog, which is mostly text anyway, does a decent job of meeting WCAGs, but I did find two notable places it fell short.\n\nThe image code I had copied over from markdown rendered images with captions instead of alt text. If the code had also put an empty string in place of the alt text (to avoid screen reader redundancy when the alt text and caption are the same), that might have been okay, but instead, the alt tag was missing entirely, so my images failed the test. I have now corrected them to contain alt text instead of captions. If I missed any, please let me know.\nIn my titles, the text over the banner image had too little contrast with the image in both light and dark mode. This was trickier to solve because I really like my banner image and did not want to change it. Instead, I dug into custom style sheet (CSS) code for text shadows. I’m bad at CSS and worse at modifying (overriding?) quarto’s default CSS, so that took a couple days. I like the result, but if you find it too hard to read, please tell me.\n\nThere are still a few other issues, such as lack of alt text for some default icons (notably the search icon). I will need to do more research on modifying quarto defaults before I can fix it.\nI also spent a lot of time reviewing audio-visual (A/V) WCAGs because I’ve been thinking about starting a podcast (short 3-5 minute speeches not unlike Toastmasters talks). It looks like the easiest thing to do would be to write out the script in advance, then use the script as the audio transcript. I’ll write more about it when I set it up.\nThe image below is a beaded ladybug. Read more about it and see my other beadwork on deviantArt. I chose this critter because I am thinking about bugs in my code."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My second contemplative prayer group reflection was due yesterday. The assignment is very open-ended: a 700 word essay about our experience or an art piece with a short description. The only theme I could think about was how the program feels very nebulous and ad hoc to me. We learn a bunch of tools, and then what? Meanwhile the ongoing (and tired) cliche at work is that we are building a plane while flying it, especially as we struggle to meet the status quo with fewer resources.\nI set that aside for a bit and spent last Saturday patronizing bookstores all over Minneapolis. I had a few coupons left over from Independent Bookstore Day back in April and wanted to use them before they expired. At one bookstore, I picked up a copy of Lynda Barry’s Making Comics. That evening, I tried a few of the exercises in it. For the exercise to draw oneself as a fruit or vegetable, I drew an adorable tamarind person.\nThe next day, after church, I sat down with my sketchbook and forced myself to draw something. The result was a partially built plane with tamarind people crawling all over it. That was the original sketch for what became my reflective piece. I wrote for my assignment,\n\nI’ve been struggling with the Transforming Hearts program because there does not seem to be a clearly defined goal. As a former teacher, I’m used to “By the end of this course, participants will …” Instead, we have been learning random things, represented by the panels for the plane’s wing in the image. Much like the people holding the panels, we are struggling to figure out how they fit together. Meanwhile, the course continues coasting along as everyone, I think including the organizers, tries to figure out what we are doing.\n\nThis image is a simplified version of my sketch, which included the whole plane, including people meditating and a lot more panels lying around. The panels being used (debated over?) include one with a spiral (the simplest form of labyrinth), one with a lit candle, and one with a singing bowl with its cushion and mallet. Our group has used all of these in various prayer practices.\nI had stated in my blog entry for my first reflection that I was hoping to create a sculpture this time. That didn’t happen, but now I want to make a crochet or plush tamarind person and I found a mini singing bowl to use as a prop, so maybe next time? The next reflection will be due in about four months.\nThe image below is my reflective piece, a cartoon of tamarind people building a plane while flying it. This one has not been posted on deviantArt yet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve mentioned in a few previous posts that I have been participating in a contemplative prayer training program through the Episcopal House of Prayer. In the June retreat we walked a standard round labyrinth and learned about labyrinth design. That led me down a rabbit hole of designing labyrinths in all sorts of shapes. To date, I have designed maybe three dozen.\nWhen I showed a few sketches to my friends at church, one mentioned a coloring book or worksheet to use in Sunday school. A coloring book sounded too complicated, so I proposed a zine instead. When I got home, I sorted through my designs and grouped them in various ways until I had a set of six that went together. The resulting zine is the Garden of Labyrinths: Meadow edition. I have most of the labyrinths designed for forest and pond editions, and a handful for a desert edition.\nMy initial goal was to complete and post a full draft of the first labyrinth by the retreat last week. At the retreat, I received feedback on the design. Today I posted a revised version, with formatting I hope to heep consistent for all editions. I will post them all on Itch.io as I complete them. My next goal is to complete the pond one by end of year.\nI created the zines to be used and shared, so if you use them, please let me know what worked for you and what didn’t. For the zines, the labyrinths need to be simple, since each one must fit within a 1/8 letter-size sheet of paper. I’ve also sketched a handful of more complex images that I still need to digitize. (I draw them all in a sketchbook first.) Eventually, when I have enogh complex images, and enough time to do the lines for them, I’ll consider turning them into a coloring book. If that would be of interest, please tell me.\nThe image below is of a labyrinth made of Speks magnets. Read more about it on deviantArt. It’s much more colorful than my zine labyrinths, which are all black lines on white paper."
