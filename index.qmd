My name is Abby Stamm. I am an artist, computer programmer, writer, and civil servant living in Minnesota. I grew up on a farm and have lived in several states and countries. I have studied a little of everything, most recently epidemiology. I enjoy writing and creating art around themes of religion, identity, culture, and animals. 

I will use several of my own art pieces as blog images. Most of my art is posted on [deviantArt](https://deviantart.com/anabiyeni). If you'd like to learn more about my work, check these links:

The painting is by my grandmother, Erdine Timberlake Stamm. She gifted it to me when I was a child because I loved that tree, which grew outside my grandparents' house in Raleigh, NC. It hangs on the wall in my home office now. The banner is a photograph that my father took when I was in middle school of the partially submerged islands in Kerr Reservoir, Virginia.


I am writing this blog in quarto using RStudio and posting it through GitHub. If you're interested in R, you can find my R packages and training resources on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ajstamm) account.
