My name is Abby Stamm. I am an artist, computer programmer, writer, and civil servant living in Minnesota. I grew up on a farm and have lived in several states and countries. I have studied a little of everything, most recently epidemiology. I enjoy writing and creating art around themes of religion, identity, culture, and animals. 


I have wanted for years to start a blog, where I could write about whatever has most recently caught my attention. (My family has wanted me to start one ever since receiving my letters home from the Pace Corps twenty years ago.) I moved to Minnesota a little over a year ago to start a new job as an informatician and joined a religious community that is not the one in which I was raised. I have been making new friends and learning new things about myself and how I identify. 

My goal with this blog is to write journal-type reflective pieces, maybe short stories about my daily experiences. I do not know yet how frequently I will update or what themes will emerge as I write.


I am writing this blog in quarto and posting it through GitHub. I use R and markdown (including quarto) extensively for work, so I am familiar with quarto and git structure. If you're interested in R, you can find my R packages and training resources on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ajstamm) account.

The painting is by my grandmother, Erdine Timberlake Stamm. She gifted it to me when I was a child because I loved that tree, which grew outside my grandparents' house in Raleigh, NC. It hangs on the wall in my home office now.

I will use several of my own art pieces as blog imges. Most of my art is posted on [deviantArt](https://deviantart.com/anabiyeni).
